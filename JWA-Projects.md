# JWA or PWA Project Guide
This markdown is an overivew of what should be achieved by each project

# Project 0

## Overview
Project 0 should be a basic REST API. 

## Past p0 proeject
[Requirements](https://gitlab.com/AdamRanieri/node-gcp-batch/-/edit/main/Projects/bankapi.md)

## Testing Requirements
- All endpoints should be tested with Postman
    - This includes having them verify the status code returned from the endpoint.
- All DAO methods must have tests showing that they work.
- Any service method that has logic in it must be tested
    - These tests should use mocking


## Goals
- Associates should be able to understand basic backend structure
- Associates should learn how to set up tests
- Associates should get first exposure to integration, unit and black-box testing

## Examples
- These examples are above and beyond normal p0s but the techniques in them should be understood
- [REST API Python](https://github.com/eSuminski/Project0)
- [REST API Java](https://github.com/dcheun/bankAPI) 


# Project 1

## Overview
Project 1 should be a small full stack application with a scope and requirements from the trainer.

## Past p1 project
[P1 Requirements](https://github.com/adamranieri/2105PythonBatch/blob/main/project1.md)

## Testing Requirements
- All endpoints should be tested with Postman
    - This includes having them verify the status code returned from the endpoint.
- All DAO methods must have tests showing that they work.
- Any service method that has logic in it must be tested
    - These tests should use mocking
- Feature files for key (can be specified by the trainer) features
- Step implementations for those features

## Goals
- Associates should be able to understand client server interaction
- Associates should learn how to set up Cucumber tests
- Associates should get first exposure to E2E testing

## Example

# Project 2

## Overview
Project 1 should be a small full stack application using frameworks. Associates should choose a p2 idea of their own.
They should use BDD to design the application and test it.

## Testing Requirements
- All endpoints should be tested with Postman
    - This includes having them verify the status code returned from the endpoint.
- All DAO methods must have tests showing that they work.
- Any service method that has logic in it must be tested
    - These tests should use mocking
- Feature files for all features
- Step implementations for those features
- Tests should be documented 
- All user stories should be documented


## Goals
- Associates should learn how BDD is used to build applications and features
- Associates should learn how to test and work on different parts and levels of the application
- Associates should learn how to create basic testing documents
